There are several different math functions you can use.  Lets just look at two of them in the program to the left. 

## round
`round` will round a float ("decimal") to however many places you need. It was used to round 2 decimal places for money in the FindSalary Example program.
  - `round(salary,2)`

## pow
`pow` will give you a number to that power.  The first number is your whole number and the second number is the power number.  
- `pow(4,2)`  is 4 squared.



Run the program to see the results
