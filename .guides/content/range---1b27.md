## range Function

The `range()` function will most often be used with a `for` Loop. You already have used it when you learned about loops.  Let's just revisit the function and look at ways it is used. 

Check out the program to the left.  It shows that the range function takes a starting number, stopping number, and a step number.  

 - `range(1,100,5)` - this would start at 1 and go by 5's till it reached 100.
 - `print()`  - notice you can leave the parentheses blank and it prints a blank line. 

Read the comments and run the program to see how it works.
