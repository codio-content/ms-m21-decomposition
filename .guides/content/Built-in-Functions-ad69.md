In the next lesson we will continue with written functions; however for now we are going to look more at built-in functions such as print and round.

There are many different ones and you can read about them all from the [Python Library Built-In Functions page](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html).  You also can look at the functions based on which version of Python you are using. 

We are just going to focus on these
  - `range()`    *You saw this used in a For Loop*
   - `print ()`
- `round()`
- `pow()`
 - `str.somefunction()`
 - `Random.somefunction()`
