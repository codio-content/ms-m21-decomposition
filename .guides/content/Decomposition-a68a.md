# Breaking things down

In Module 1 we looked at how to take a problem and break it down in to step by step processes. Remember how to tie your shoe?

In the previous lesson we looked at how images were made up of tiny pixels.

As you can see almost anything we look at is made up of something else; either steps, pixels or many other things.  

In Computer Science, decomposition is breaking a complex problem into smaller parts that are easier to program or solve.
