# Functions
So what does decomposition look like in programming?  There are several ways it transitions to code but one of the easiest is through functions.  Python calls them functions but you may have seen them as methods or procedures in other programming languages. 

Functions in Python are basically a decomposed step of a problem.  That smaller problem is then programmed in a function (think the 3-5 smaller steps).  Then in the main part of the program it only looks at the main steps (EX: How much can you afford)
