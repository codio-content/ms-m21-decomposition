`random` is a little unique in that it is an actual program itself.  We call that a class.  When a class has several different functions we want to use we need to do this by using the class name and then the function. 

    classname.functionname()  
      translates to 
    random.randrange(10)
    
Notice also at the beginning of the program is import random.  This is necessary to tell your program to import the functions from the random class.

`randrange` is similar to range.  It can have a start number, end number, and the specify a step number for the numbers you want.  Such as the even number example to the left.

You also can you choice to get something from a list such as a letter. 

`random()` is fun to use for guessing game programs for starting out programming. 

Run the program mulitple times to get different answers.
