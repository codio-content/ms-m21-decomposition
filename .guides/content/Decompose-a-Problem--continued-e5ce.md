## Compare your steps to the ones below. 

1. Figure out how much you can spend
1. Determine what type of vehicle you need/want
1. Research what dealers have those types
1. Go to dealership, test drive cars (could repeat this step â€“ LOOP)
1. Negotiate sale and purchase

## Decomposing the Problem

Lets assume these are the main steps you would take and that you have successfully decomposed the problem.  At this point you would look at each step as its own problem.  Each step could be another problem to decompose or it could be just small steps you need to take.  By looking at each one separately it is easier to solve. 
Example:
1. Figure out how much you can spend
--	Look up your monthly pay
--	Figure out all of your current bills
--	Subtract bills from monthly pay
--	See what is left and decide on what you can pay per month for car.

For each one of the steps at the top you could figure out 3-5 steps for each one.  When you are only thinking about one thing (how much you can spend) it is much easier to break it down.
